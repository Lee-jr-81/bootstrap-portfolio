# bootstrap-portfolio

## Description

Having worked on adding a new technology into my working stack, in this case, bootstrap. I have re-factored my developer portfolio to trial the bootstrap workflow and see how/what benefits a framework brings to the table.

I have discovered that using a css framework hugely speeds up the responsive element of css. I will be bringing this workflow into my future works.
